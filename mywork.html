                <p class="about-p"> What drives me is to find my own place in this world. A drive to push me as a person to my very limitâ€™s every day. A drive to have something to call my own. 

                    During this pandemic.  I have been studying HTML,CSS, JavaScript and more at least 2 hours each day. To finally put down the curse That has been cursing my family for generations. 

                    I want to be the first in my family to break out of the retail and factory hole.

            <div class="section-title-1">What I am like?</div>
            <p class="about-p"> 
   My attitude can be summed up in three words "Nobody is perfect". Everyone can still learn. Like how You don't really touch CSS. When You learn about SCSS. Or with the classical border type or learning about new unique things that you can learn with your favorite coding language of choice    We all can learn from each other from people with different mindsets than your own. Someone with a different view can see something that someone did not know was wrong.

            <div class="section-title-1">What I do in freetime?</div>
            <p class="about-p"> What I like to do while not studying or learning to better myself. Is that I like to feed ducks and go walking.  

                I find the experience truly relaxing. I have been feeding ducks for so long that they recognize my voice and eat from my hand. Most of my many idea's come from a session of just relaxing at the park and just thinking.
